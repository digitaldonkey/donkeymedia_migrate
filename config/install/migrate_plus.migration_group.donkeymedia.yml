# A "migration group" is - surprise! - a group of migrations. It is used to
# group migrations for display by our tools, and to perform operations on a
# specific set of migrations. It can also be used to hold any configuration
# common to those migrations, so it doesn't have to be duplicated in each one.

# The machine name of the group, by which it is referenced in individual
# migrations.
id: donkeymedia

# A human-friendly label for the group.
label: Donkeymedia Imports

# More information about the group.

# Short description of the type of source, e.g. "Drupal 6" or "WordPress".
source_type: WordPress

# Here we add any default configuration settings to be shared among all
# migrations in the group. For this example, the source tables are in the
# Drupal (default) database, but usually if your source data is in a
# database it will be external.
shared_configuration:
  # Specifying 'source' here means that this configuration will be merged into
  # the 'source' configuration of each migration.
  source:
    # Wordpress Export XML or .wxr file.

    urls: /Users/tho/htdocs/donkeymedia-d8-repo/wp-migrate/donkeymedia.wordpress.xml

    # A better practice for real-world migrations would be to add a database
    # connection to your external database in settings.php and reference its
    # key here.
